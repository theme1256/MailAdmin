# MailAdmin

An interface to control mail aliases and lists in the iRedAdmin MySQL/MariaDB-database.

Is an alternative to the iRedAdmin-Pro interface, if all that is needed is control of aliases and lists.

Planed expantion is to be able to control white-, grey- and black-listing.

## Roadmap

* Get aliases and lists working
* Get grey-, white- and black-listing working
