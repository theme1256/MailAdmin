# MailAdmin

An interface to control mail aliases and lists in the iRedAdmin MySQL/MariaDB-database.

Is an alternative to the iRedAdmin-Pro interface, if all that is needed is control of aliases and lists.

## Roadmap

- [x] Get aliases and lists working
- [x] Add forwards to a local email
- [ ] Get catch-all working
- [ ] Set up and modify moderators
- [ ] Set up piping to an external script
- [ ] Get grey-, white- and black-listing working
